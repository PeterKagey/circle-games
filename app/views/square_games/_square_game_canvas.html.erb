	Here's how you play:<br>
	Connect every number to every other number in as few circles as possible. <br>
	Click on a link under "Best Solutions" for some examples. <br>
	The circle in the left hand corner records the highest number that is fully connected. <br>
	The circle to the right of that records how many circles are in play.<br>
	The "S" button will allow you to submit your score and update the high-scores table.<br>
	The circles in the right hand corner let you change how high you can select.<br>
	Right clicking on a circle will remove it.
